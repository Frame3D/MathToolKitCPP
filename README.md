MathToolKit is a complete framework for linear algebra and differential equations solving in C++. It's a tool box to ease maths and physics in C++. It's the ultimate framework to perform fast and efficient scientific calculation and AI.

### NAlgebra

#### Overview

Representing classic linear algebra objects such as euclidean vectors, matrices, tensors... Use a python-like syntax to perform common operations such as +, *, linear mapping...

Featuring :
  - NVector : N-dimensional vectors. Featuring algebraical operations (E, +, *), swaps, shifts and classic vectors generator such as ones, zeros...
  
  - ENVector : Euclidean space vectors. Inherits from NVector. Featuring norm, comparison between vectors and distance.
  
  - NPMAtrix : NxP matrices. Featuring algebraical operations such as matrix product, linear map, gauss jordan elimination. Setters & getters, swappers and classic matrix generators such as ones, zeros...
  
  - NMatrix : Featuring LU decomposition, classic matrix recognition & generation (lower, upper, diag, eye...), linear systems solving, matrix inversion and determinant, fast exponentiation...
  
  - Vector3 : Featuring cross product, coordinate transforms and rotation.
